## Academic Module Setup (Admin Section)
### Overview
The Academic module is the core of the school management system, where the administrator can configure and manage the academic structure of the institution. The following are the key components of the Academic module:

### Components
Subjects: Admin can manage the list of subjects that are taught in the institution. This includes adding new subjects, editing existing ones, and assigning them to specific year groups or programs.

#### Programs: The admin can create and manage various academic programs offered by the institution. Programs may consist of a set of subjects and are usually associated with a particular level of study or department.

#### Student Admission: The administration of student admissions falls here, where the admin can oversee the entire admission process from application to enrollment.

#### Staff Employment: This component deals with the hiring and management of teaching and non-teaching staff, including their roles, permissions, and personal information management.

#### Academic Year: Administrators define the start and end dates of an academic year, and it's often the top-level time frame for planning the academic calendar.

#### Academic Term: This refers to the division of the academic year into terms or semesters. Admins set up term dates and associate them with the corresponding academic activities.

#### Year Group: The admin can set up and manage year groups or classes, assign students to them, and track their progress throughout the academic year.
